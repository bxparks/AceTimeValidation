# ExtendedNodaTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`ExtendedZoneProcessor` class (which uses the `zonedbx` data files) with the
`validation_data.cpp` file generated by the
[compare_noda](../tools/compare_noda) C# program using [Noda
Time](https://nodatime.org/).

## Requirements

* Install .NET 6.0
    * https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/linux-ubuntu
* Clone the Noda Time repo as sibling to `AceTime`
    * `$ git clone https://github.com/nodatime/nodatime`
    * Update the `NODA_TIME_DIR` parameter in the `Makefile`
* Clone the EpoxyDuino repo as a sibling to `AceTime`
    * `$ git clone https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino.git`

## Running the Test

The validation test runs on a Linux machine using the
[EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adapter layer.
Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:
```
$ make clean
$ make

$ make run

## Noda Time Version

The Noda Time library allows the NodaZoneData file to be generated dynamically
from the original IANA TZDB files (https://nodatime.org/3.0.x/userguide/tzdb).
The `$(TZ_VERSION)` in the `Makefile` specifies the TZDB version. The custom TZ
configuration happens in 2 steps:

* `tzdata$(TZ_VERSION).nzd`:
    * The NodaZoneData file is created by runing the `TzdbCompiler` from the
      Noda Time source repo.
    * The `TzdbCompiler` automatically downloads the
      `tar.gz` file from https://data.iana.org/time-zones/releases/.
* `validation_data.json`:
    * The `compare_noda` program is given the `--nzd_file` flag which tells the
      program to look for the NodaZoneData file at the given file path.
