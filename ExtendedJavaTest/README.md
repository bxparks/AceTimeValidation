# ExtendedJavaTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`ExtendedZoneProcessor` class (which uses the `zonedbx` data files) with the
`validation_data.cpp` file generated by the
[compare_java](../tools/compare_java) Java program.

## Running the Test

The validation test runs on a Linux machine using the
[EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adapter layer.
Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:
```
$ make clean
$ make

$ make runtests

```

## Java JDK Version

The TZ Database version used by the `GenerateData.java` program and the
version that generated the `zonedbx` files must match for this unit test to
succeed. For example, one of JDK versions used to run this test was `openjdk
version "11.0.3" 2019-04-16` (see `java -version`) which seems to use version
2018g. So the `Makefile generates the zoneinfo files for `2018g` specifically
for this test.

## Compiling the Java Generator

The `Makefile` will automatically compile the
`../tools/compare_java/GenerateData.java` program into a `GenerateData.class` if
it has not already been generated. To compile manually,

```
$ cd ../tools/compare_java
$ make
