# LibcExtendedTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`ExtendedZoneProcessor` class with the `validation_data.cpp` file generated by
the [tools/compare_c](../../tools/compare_c) program which uses the standard C
libc library.

## Running the Test

The validation test runs on a Linux machine using the
[EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adapter layer.
Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:

```
$ make clean
$ make

$ make run
TestRunner started on 266 test(s).
Test ExtendedTransitionTest_Africa_Abidjan passed.
...
Test ExtendedTransitionTest_WET passed.
TestRunner duration: 2.611 seconds.
TestRunner summary: 356 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 timed out, out of 356 test(s).
```

## Compiling the Validation Data Generator

The `Makefile` attempts to compile the [tools/compare_c](../../tools/compare_c)
program if necessary. To recompile it manually, type the following:

```
$ cd ../../tools/compare_c
$ make clean
$ make
```
