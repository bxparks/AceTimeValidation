# ZoneInfoBasicTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`BasicZoneProcessor` class with the `validation_data.cpp` file generated by the
[tools/compare_zoneinfo](../../tools/compare_zoneinfo) program which uses the
[zoneinfo](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html) library first
included with Python 3.9. The
[backports.zoneinfo](https://pypi.org/project/backports.zoneinfo/) package is
used for Python 3.7 and 3.8.

[EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adapter layer.
