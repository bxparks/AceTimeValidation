# HinnantExtendedTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`ExtendedZoneProcessor` class with the `validation_data.cpp` file generated by
the [tools/compare_cpp](../../tools/compare_cpp) program which uses the [Hinnant
Date](https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date) library.

## Running the Test

The validation test runs on a Linux machine using the
[EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adapter layer.
Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:

```
$ make clean
$ make

$ make run
TestRunner started on 387 test(s).
Test ExtendedTransitionTest_Africa_Abidjan passed.
...
Test ExtendedTransitionTest_WET passed.
TestRunner duration: 2.561 seconds.
TestRunner summary: 268 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, 0 timed out, out of 268 test(s).
```

## Compiling the Validation Data Generator

The `Makefile` attempts to compile the
[tools/compare_cpp](../../tools/compare_cpp) program if necessary. To recompile
it manually, type the following:

```
$ cd ../../tools/compare_cpp
$ make clean
$ make
```
