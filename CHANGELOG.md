- 1.7.0 (2023-06-27, TZDB 2023c)
    - tools
        - Add `compare_acetimego`.
        - Fix `int` overflow bugs when calculating the epochSeconds beyond a
          32-bit signed integer:
            - `compare_noda`
            - `compare_java`
        - Add `offset_granularity` to `validation_data.json` to allow
          `acetime_basic.txt` and `acetime_extended.txt` to be compared
          against `acetime_complete.txt` by truncating the expected offset
          values.
    - validation:
        - Set `START_YEAR`, `UNTIL_YEAR` to `[1800,2200)` which covers
          all DST transitions in the IANA TZ database (`[1844,2087]`).
        - Support `--scope complete` and the `zonedbc` database for AceTime.
        - Add validation tests for `[1800,2200)` which covers all DST
          transitions in the IANA TZDB `[1844,2087)`.
            - `diff_acetime_complete`
            - `diff_acetimec`
            - `diff_acetimego`
            - `diff_acetimepy`
            - `diff_hinnant`
        - Add validation tests that handle scope=basic and scope=extended
          subsets:
            - `diff_acetime_basic`
            - `diff_acetime_extended`
        - Implement targets for other third party libraries:
            - `diff_libc` - conformant
            - `diff_noda` - conformant
            - `diff_zoneinfo` - errors on 32 zones
            - `diff_gotime` - errors on 23 zones
            - `diff_java` - errors on ~10 zones
    - Set `baseline.txt` to be `acetime_complete.txt`.
        - This allows us to validation AceTime (complete) against all other
          third party libraries.
- 1.6.0 (2023-05-30, TZDB 2023c)
    - Split the `test_data` component of `validation_data.json` into 2 lists:
        - `transitions` containing DST transitions of the timezone, and
        - `samples` containing samples from `start_year` to `until_year`
    - `./tools/compare_xxx`
        - Update scripts to generate `validation_data.json` with split
          `transitions` and `samples`.
        - Add `compare_acetime` using AceTime library.
        - Rename `compare_c` to `compare_libc`
        - Rename `compare_cpp` to `compare_hinnant`
        - Rename `compare_go` to `compare_gotime`
    - `./validation`
        - Add files to support peer-to-peer validation.
        - Add 'make validation' target which compares raw JSON files from
          `compare_acetime`, `compare_acetimec`, `compare_acetz`, and
          `compare_hinnant`.
    - `./tests/`
        - Move top-level `BasicXxxTest` and `ExtendedXxxtest` to be under new
          `tests/` subdirectory.
        - Rename `{Basic,Extended}XxxTest` to `Xxx{Basic,Extended}Test`.
        - Add AcetimecExtendedTest to `tests` and `runtests` targets.
            - Assumes that the acetimec library will be kept up to date with the
              latest TZDB version.
    - Rename `AceTimePython` library to `acetimepy`.
    - Rename `AceTimeC` library to `acetimec`.
    - Rename `AceTimeGo` library to `acetimego`.
- 1.5.2 (2023-04-01, TZDB 2023c)
    - Upgrade TZDB from 2023b to 2023c.
        - https://mm.icann.org/pipermail/tz-announce/2023-March/000079.html
            - "This release's code and data are identical to 2023a.  In other
              words, this release reverts all changes made in 2023b other than
              commentary, as that appears to be the best of a bad set of
              short-notice choices for modeling this week's daylight saving
              chaos in Lebanon."
    - AceTimeValidation is forced to upgrade to 2023c, because we skipped 2023a
      and went directly to 2023b, which is being rolled back by 2023c.
- 1.5.1 (2023-03-24, TZDB 2023b)
