# ExtendedZoneInfoTest

This unit test compares the DST transitions calculated by the
`ExtendedZoneProcessor` class with the `validation_data.cpp` file generated by
the [compare_zoneinfo](tools/compare_zoneinfo) program which uses the
[zoneinfo](https://docs.python.org/3/library/zoneinfo.html) library first
included with Python 3.9. The
[backports.zoneinfo](https://pypi.org/project/backports.zoneinfo/) package is
used for Python 3.7 and 3.8.

## Running the Test

The Python tool generates about 130,000 data points spanning the year 2000 to
2038. It is too large to run on any Arduino board that I am aware of, including
the ESP32.

The unit test does run on a Linux machine using the
[EpoxyDuino](https://github.com/bxparks/EpoxyDuino) adapter layer.
Assuming that you have `g++` and `make` installed, just type:

```
$ make

$ make runtests
